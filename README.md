## Speakit

Speakit is an app developed using Google's Google Cloud Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text APIs to help children with Speech Delay. This app has two main features:

- **Learning:**
Learning allows the user to play the associated word/sound from the word and then recording their own version trying to mimic the sound. If the the sound corresponds to the recording then the User has correctly spoken the word.
